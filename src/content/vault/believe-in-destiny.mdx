Uhmmm it's a plethora of phases to go through mostly I'll summarize many parts of it because most parts are recurring

My life from 18-23 has been a pure roller coaster ride for it's own reasons. The life normal kids live after 21 , I have been doing it before 18 and so I explored alot of things earlier than what's normal

Abhi 18 se shuru karenge toh pura kitaab likhna padega but just know I was living life at it's top level just chilling and crashing everyday with my constant people

Abhi to understand what drove me to my personality today you have to understand many parts of it after the halal seperation matlab 2021 ke baadh kya hua aur maine kaise apne aap ko badla , Alhamdulillah it's long but worth it.

I thought you should know about this because for the past one week my two friends shais and hanif have been around me and I sit with them till midnight and I open up to them everything and they often tell me I'm really different or like I went that point where most people don't and so I thought you should know that before you understand how I reached abhi into my new direction. I was mental past one week singing , talking to random things just so lost and just yesterday I don't know suddenly I got this current shock into recovering when I had a chat with hanif , No hopes but I never realised this is not the end because mai mental tha na

But let's go to that point first , The period before that realization point hit me. Bear with me this would be mature and really frank talk but we're good enough to discuss it all and you're as much or more mature than myself haha

I was a proper druggy partying all day everyday , I sometimes get scared about you in bangalore because of my own past, Matlab mujhe toh uss time mai kuch aur karne ke liye hai nahi tha aur dost bhi aaisai hi the , I was that macho cool party head always raving giving positive vibes all haram with very little emaan but never complete 0 or maybe but thoda toh tah warna kabhi change nahi hoa sakthe na. I was very comfortable with my life party kar rahe the , paisa milthe the, I had a great partner and a beautiful relationship and life was you know in the flow..

Mai third person terms use karunga `she , partner , her` means `aap` `bonding` means samjho of all type `emotional , physical and mental` like how I explained my friends so you'll get the feel better

Aur as much as I was a party freak , I always had my boundries in my greatest highs or flips , I always kept my friends close and any opposite gender 5km away from my radius and this loyalty was some characteristic built into me because I always respected my partner. Ups and downs the but I never dared to cross any limits until now I can say without any hesitation comparing with what you would see today , I was just doing right things in matter of my commitment towards my partner. My partner was at this point an integral part of me, Matlab no matter kitna nashedi tha raath ko wapas aana hi tha to your heart, No matter how much we met or connected it was always a need for more or more of a mutually built deep bonded relationship, We never used to get tired of each other aise hi I was living the dream at that point.

As this grew in me and time moved by mujhe yeh samajh mein aane lage allah ke qadr ki zindagi toh inn sabh se uppar hai, It's a different high that I need to experience by disconnecting myself from these kind of people and circles and all the things I thought was cool

Iss time takh me and my partner were very close, Wherever I have been travelling or exploring or whatever I have done in my dumb college years, I never broke the perfect bonding no matter what it was, Kyunki nahi kar pathe na, Jo bhi kartha tha wapas jaana thi uske paas kyunki I felt we just couples living like the married and it is , was, will be beautiful , Surely problems rehthe it's the essence of good relationship and my partner often tried to question my actions aur aise jagde hoathe lekin kabhi bohut time ek doosre dhoor tho nahi reh saktha tha, eventually I reached that point ki mujhe badlna tha life mai , Abhi aap samajh gaye ki iss point tak bandha toh ek dum pagal hai drug addict type doing all sorts of things, But phir bhi bohut loyal hai matlab it's a rare combination ki koi aise ho sakthe hai kyunki mostly such people cheat or lose interest or seek lust, mai toh tha hi alag type ka hehe

Abhi woh point toh aa gaye life mai ki kuch karne hai, life mai kuch karna hai, Inn sabh duniya se bahar aana hai, Kill those circles and build my potential. Lekin jitna easily main bolthe hai maine kar ke dikaye hai utna easy kabhi rehthe nahi , Do you know I'm the only one who changed in my squad and seperated? Iss point tak mera loyalty factor overtook all my pleasures lekin phir emaan bohut kam lag rahe the , Toh abhi bhi kamiya thi zindagi mai

I wasn't free purre tarah see , Abhi 2021 ho gaye, Sabhi drugs and party bandh kiye once and for all yeh soch kar ki abhi I'll change because I need a life with my partner aur I want to give back my parents lekin it was always the love factor kyunki parents ke baare mai socthe toh pehle yeh sabh mai nahi karthe? We are too immature or naive to think waise , Aur utna emaan bhi nahi ki yeh soche ki galat hai aur nahi karni hai nah nah toh mere paas toh itna acha relationship tha and I wanted it forever

Sach bolun toh I didn't struggle with quitting any drugs , I was so happily away from everything that affected the things that ruined me and the relationship between my partner. Abhi pehle mei kisi aur ladkiyon se baath nahi karthe, interest bhi nahi tha, Yes kabhi galthiyan ho jathe account dekthe or maybe some stupid things but nothing serious always in character, Yeh badthe gaye samay ke saath

Abhi mujhe mukth hona tha cigarettes aur choti nashon se aur phir se maine struggle karne shuru kiye , iss phase mai I split with my partner from haram relationship and it was hard mentally stressful lekin mai toh abhi salah padthe the, career mai focused the aur naye goals rakhne lagge the

It was never easy during those times lekin roz khud ko bolthe the ki one day you'll make it , Jab bhi mann karthe kuch karne ki matlab human temptation or teenage urges (aapko patha hai kuch galat cheez smoking ya phir kuch bhi male hormone problems) I used to think if my partner was around what she would think, What if I lose her doing this , Phir months of struggle ke baadh mere emaan bohut badhne lage , Sacrifices karthe partner ke baare mai soch ke kuch aise conclusions hue ki outcome positive hi hoaga, Inn kuch maaheno mai mene bohut haram cheeze chodd dhi, Complete social media , wrong people , wrong habits , music , movies , sabh kuch aur thodi si bhi woh difficulty nahi thi because I was happily focused

Bohut hard times the matlab bass padhna aur content banana , kaam dhoondna zindagi banena ka soch, raath bar i used to cry thinking so much then I would think the good days to come with my partner if I made it and I would tell her everything on how I suffered through the storm to fight myself just the thought of her presence indirectly helped me cope up to through so much pain, Mai kabhi chodd nahi sakthe the usse because I had bonding at a deep level, Aise baath cheeth ristha nahi the, Once you take the bonding to some level then you can't break that level of commitment, Mai bohut weird ho gaye, I distanced myself from stranger ladies always looking down and never ever talking or making 0 acquittances, kabhi kabhi when partner text or change dp bohut insecure hoatha bohut socthe what's happening, kyunki kyun nahi? Apne hi hoane wale aur pretty bhi hai so ofcourse jealous ho jathe agar aap jealous nahi toh usme mazza ha ya na? phir I just trust the honesty and move on happily , Bohut dinno kuch kar nahi paathe kyunki it's so hard to study so much engineering coding and find job aur phir settle hoana , Lekin Mai focused tha dairy likthe the time pe soana , kitaabein padhna project banana schedule mai the life.

Aur sabhi hard times mai toh bas the good outcome socthe the , Raath bar namaz padthe the , changes dekhne lage, kaam milne lage, Phir easy nahi the fighting temptation on one side , trying to balance life on another , phir life ka tension

Maine kabhi na matlab parents ke baare mai utna nahi soacha kyunki if I'm successful anyway they'll benefit from it par my partner was a need kyunki I didn't know kya hoathe agar mai khud ke perr, Arrey mere ek pura support system thi na partner, mere life mai wapas laye, Mai toh sapna saalon mai karthe the not months, 10 years or something from now

Abhi toh sabhi cheezon se muqt the, Just in my room hustling ache ki khoj, content likhna , ache umeed aur bohut saare khwab to some unfinished story, Abhi sabhi bolthe the mujhe you're missing out on life yeh woh bla bla maine kabhi sunna hi nahi I was too focused on what kept me happy, Kabhi kabhi matches haarthe hai, kuch ache moments life mai miss ho jathe maybe travelling, Mai khud ke paison se jaane ke liye ya phir maybe if my parnter wouldn't like this aise sochke bohut saare choices banathe, I never regretted because I'd be happy walking in small park outside my flat with my support system than chill around north with my friends.

Bohut baar I used to regret for my past and time I spent busy matlab aise socthe the ki you didn't do enough for your partner, You never realised her value or told her enough that she is special, she is pretty and cry on all of that lekin distance rakthe kabhi sorry nahi bol paathe , Phir bhi ache hopes rakthe the ki sabh theek ho jayenge

Phir dheere dheere friends change hue , life mai concentrated dosth mil gaye, football ban gaye zindagi aur bas kaam karthe rahe , job mil gaye yeh sabh toh ek hi flow mai the , Alhamdulillah. Emaan ache ho gaye, I was free from everything that held me back.

Kabhi kabhi khud socthe the ki mai partner se jaake baath karlun call karlun ek baar miltha toh sabh kuch bol sakthe ki I finally made it matlab it was so huge for me itni kam samay mai bohut karr rahe the , Struggles abhi bhi the kyunki temptations shaitaan dethe rehthe the, I finally made it matlab aise nahi ki I'm totally capable matlab I'm now thoda independent

Aapko patha hai wo kuch maheene kaise jeethe the? I quit YouTube and all entertainment so I wouldn't be distracted to comit any sin, Matlab aap bolthe na don't be nerdo hehe mujhe na koi aur option hi nahi thi, Mere habits itni bad thi I had to be strict on myself even during my struggles kabhi kabhi khud miserable feel hoathe the aur roathe the phir theek ho jathe the, Kabhi aise socthe ki iss duniya mai koi nahi samajh paathe lekin phir ek din woh samjhenge. I rested all my cases to the lord. Mai quran padhne lagge, mai molvi jaise ho gaye ghar se masjid , masjid se ghar aur kuch aur nahi just saying no to short term pleasure for something long term.

Nacthe the kuch nasha jaisa tha, khwaab dekthe the nahathe waqt like a king kuch ajeeb random random things, Dropping her at college one day, fighting for her pride one day, Taking her to countries she loved, Building sand castles together, Showing my charm and making her parents laugh and dreaming of a family , Arrey sach much pagal tha mai

Arrey koi kyun rahenge ek drug addict ya phir aise harkath karthe insaan ke saath itne saal? Kyunki woh bohut different thi, aage hai sabhi ladkiyon se kyunki usne kiya vishwas aur trust diye uske mujh par, It's a blessing kethe hai na wife material, It's a forever to dream with somebody's presence impacted your career

Abhi kahin maaheno baadh na mujhe sabh ache line pe aane lagge the college khatham, no more tension of going to strange people, Mujhe bohut darr hoathe the didn't talk to strange women all considered me weird NRI par mai khud ek alag hi comfort zone mai the of commitment to one. Baadh mai partner banglore mai padhne lage good friends banaye jn college and all lekin pehle she didn't like all that good friends and all, I always told myself agar aap nahi chahthe woh kisi se baath karre toh aap bhi bohut door rehne chahiye from any stranger hehe

Abhi toh indian chapter was coming to an end by this point, Kyunki Alhamdulillah life was improvising and my partner was constantly there like a guide and I just wanted my biggest desire my support system!

Saudi aaye toh patha challe ki mere sabh dost badal gaye the, All wanted to quit smoking , many are working, many wants to get married, many are doing business, Toh abhi bhi they smoke flavoured pods (I admit mai bhi at times) but sabhi zindagi mai badal gaye the working and wanting to grow. Yeh pods bhi sabhi stop karenge, I feel pods are fine better than going to worse things but eventually sabh woh bhi quit karenge woh sabh chodo generally everything was much better

Abhi toh saare dosth jo party karthe the saath mei khaana khathe masjid jaathe baath karthe aur ghar jaathe bas aur kuch nahi , It was a different feeling and all along this I was finding a settling happiness to get back one day with some affirmation ki yeh ho jayega kyunki everybody told me you're different itna ki mere sisters bolthe ki it's possible sabh bolthe the.

Maana ki my partner kehthe the it's naseeb and all that but somewhere mai sochne lagge ki ho jayega , bohut din hindi mai practice karthe teh talking to her dad haha, And it was like every single day I controlled and tamed myself on this thought and built things around it because **this bond was just different, It never changed, it has been 5 years now**, Sabh friends bolthe mujhse help chahiye losing interest, Silently I smiled thinking Alhamdulillah I'm lucky ..

Aap hi socho aise mai when a man is at this stage of commitment and you know madly in love **_even if many barriers seperate them, Several sacrifices and several trials but still he wishes to endure more because he see's his peace, He knows she's home, He comes back from work stressed he knows she's there and he wants it be only her. You want the truth , My partner was everything to me. I found my peace in her and I just wanted to settle there and I was ready to work at any level, give up anything just to do all the cool things I missed out in life alongside her._**

Abhi story toh complete nahi hai lekin you're getting an idea over these years how I have been telling myself of an imaginary ending while taming myself and how I built the direction. It was maybe 10% parents, 85% her and 5% myself. Iss point tak toh my friends roane lagge almost I told them and you stupid guys telling me to chill and calm down? Hahaha

One day you wakeup and this dream is not there? Can you do it? Can you wakeup next day forgetting or believing something? Maybe I can accept naseeb but do you think my heart will forgive me? My body was so foreign to this feeling, If somebody told me like your partner and you are so deep what if they don't work? I used to walk away from that conversation, Arrey one small negativity and I couldn't let it enter me, Aise insaan kaise seh payega a complete reality without her? How will he explain the world that he has gone mad, deeply mad..? Nobody understands him because nobody has ever known of his struggle except him. If somebody has done so much for just getting a forever with someone in a halal way, then he some rights to cry? To hope little more? To to to to dream little more?

Haaan sahi hai mai tha alag hi deewana, And I still am and I always will be because that's where I'm rooted from and my personality was born from. Mai kabhi itne jaldi haar nahi maanthe, Abhi toh yeh sabh padhne ke baadh aapko patha chala ki mere kaise matlab aise ho gaye halat pichle kuch dino mai, Lekin maine phirse soachne shuru kiye

Aur woh sabh mai ek alag hi notes mai aapko batha de chuka hun jo abhi kho gaye, Unfortunately this is the only PDF I could find!
